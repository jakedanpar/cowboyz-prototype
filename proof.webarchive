 (transition-arrive: "pulse") [[COWBOYZ]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="COWBOYZ" tags="" position="333,33" size="100,100">It might be time to think about why cowboys are following me. Not real cow herders on horses of course, but the image of them, their culture.

It‚Äôs a little surprising to be honest, given that I‚Äôm not someone who falls for the plastic-wrapped charm of the USA. But haughty hunks in broad brimmed hats have always appeared in popular culture. My memory of them in //Red Dead Redemption// and sexy advertisements  (click-replace: "sexy advertisements") [petrol station porn mags] (click-replace: "petrol station porn mags") [erotic novels at Target] is no exception. They‚Äôve been the staple image of the American Dream‚Äîor perhaps more accurately the Capitalist‚Äôs Dream.

They are synonymous with heroism, machismo, and white man‚Äôs honour. 

All in all, not a very flattering package in progressive circles today; and yet, cowboys and their aesthetic are still widely [[celebrated]].

Western movies [[aside]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="celebrated" tags="" position="463,36" size="100,100">A cowboy in the modern world is also a cowgirl, a cowperson, an emoji. They are [[style icons]] who have roamed beyond the modest landscape of countryside ranches and into urban settings.

Clearly there is still something in the spirit of these boot scootin‚Äô babies which has adapted to modernity.

Perhaps cowboys can tell us something about [[‚ÄòThe West‚Äô]]‚Äînow a borderless and arguably wilder part of the world‚Äîand what it represents today.

It‚Äôs a much smaller community now. Many users deactivated their blogs after Yahoo budged their conservative Christian elbows in with a PG-rated agenda. Erotic images and blogs‚Äîone of the larger economies on Tumblr‚Äîwere deleted or censored as ‚Äòsensitive material‚Äô.

What this has left is fashion, fashion, flower, fashion. I‚Äôm not anti-fashion, but I‚Äôm also not pro-fashion blog so it‚Äôs been a lot of [[speed-scrolling]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="‚ÄòThe West‚Äô" tags="" position="543,174" size="100,100">A friend once declared to me that Western movies are boring. And sure, they're mostly white guys running around delivering BDE monologues and breaking it up with some pew-pew pow-pow, but at the same time I felt the urge to disagree. These films make grittiness, action and drama a grand spectacle (think of the long held pause before John Wayne pulls his gun, quick flash). The chewy tobacco, blood, and thick twangy accents make for a rich portrait of unaware theatricality.

In truth, these films are nothing short of camp.

Maybe using this word will enrage Susan Sontag enough to claw through her coffin, but there is something undeniably over-the-top about men in chaps spitting philosophical asides. Which often leads me to [[wonder:-&gt;a lot]]

This cocky runway cowboy‚Äîdespite all his crudeness and symmetry‚Äîis somehow easy to stare at. This makes sense after scrolling through the post's notes which speak hormonally charged volumes that I‚Äôm sure go against Yahoo‚Äôs policy guidelines.

What this model is mimicking on a high fashion runway is something that I‚Äôve questioned [[a lot]]:</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="a lot" tags="gay-thing" position="545,322" size="100,100">


WHEN DID COWBOYS BECOME A GAY THING?

The song itself is a sexualised ballad infused with conventional folk sounds. She sings of love, lust and empowerment, all in a soundscape that sounds as though it was birthed in a ranch and shipped off in a tractor to be done up in the city. How this could be considered a song of queer admiration is largely implicit. I could rely on the self-explanatory answer of ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Kylie!‚Äô, but truly I think the explanation can be found in the song‚Äôs [[lyrics:]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="üé¨" tags="" position="581,467" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="üïØÔ∏è" tags="" position="704,423" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="lyrics:" tags="" position="428,599" size="100,100">//Found my voice to have my say
You take me close to far away
And now I find and now I feel
The ordinary is surreal
Peace and terror all in one
My future life has just [[begun]]//</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="begun" tags="" position="422,729" size="100,100">Evidently the lyrics steer away from any typical cowboy tropes; but nonetheless, Kylie expresses a kind of typical cowboy philosophy here: a rumination that expresses individual journey(click-replace: "a rumination that expresses individual journey") [//click clacking on a horse through the desert//], disorientation(click-replace: "disorientation") [//is the lonely life for me?//], and a conclusive sense of growth and triumph(click-replace: "and a conclusive sense of growth and triumph") [//it‚Äôs just me, my horse, and my harmonica//]. I‚Äôve often thought about this narrative‚Äîincorrigible again!‚Äîand have come to consider it a similitude of queer empowerment.

Where she sings of ‚Äòfinding her voice‚Äô and encountering the ‚Äòsurreal‚Äô, I imagine queer people in the heat of self-discovery. I imagine shaky knees when approaching a dancefloor because actualising a queer sexuality‚Äîa limb of one‚Äôs identity‚Äîis a process which demands a submission to the non-normative and this, in fact, is a ‚Äúpeace and terror all in one‚Äù.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
