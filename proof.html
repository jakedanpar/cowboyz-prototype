It‚Äôs a little surprising to be honest, given that I‚Äôm not someone who falls for the plastic-wrapped charm of the USA. But haughty hunks in broad brimmed hats have always appeared in popular culture. My memory of them in //Red Dead Redemption// and sexy advertisements  (click-replace: &quot;sexy advertisements&quot;) [petrol station porn mags] (click-replace: &quot;petrol station porn mags&quot;) [erotic novels at Target] is no exception. They‚Äôve been the staple image of the American Dream‚Äîor perhaps more accurately the Capitalist‚Äôs Dream.

They are synonymous with heroism, machismo, and white man‚Äôs honour. 

All in all, not a very flattering package in progressive circles today; and yet, cowboys and their aesthetic are still widely [[celebrated]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="celebrated" tags="" position="463,26" size="100,100">A cowboy in the modern world is also a cowgirl, a cowperson, an emoji. They are [[style icons]] who have roamed beyond the modest landscape of countryside ranches and into urban settings.

Clearly there is still something in the spirit of these boot scootin‚Äô babies which has adapted to modernity.

Perhaps cowboys can tell us something about [[‚ÄòThe West‚Äô]]‚Äînow a borderless and arguably wilder part of the world‚Äîand what it represents today.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="style icons" tags="" position="404,152" size="100,100">Nostalgically(click-replace: &quot;Nostalgically&quot;)[Obsessively](click-replace: &quot;Obsessively&quot;)[Unashamedly](click-replace: &quot;Unashamedly&quot;)[Nostalgically], I‚Äôve become a Tumblr user again.

WHEN DID COWBOYS BECOME A &#39;GAY&#39; THING?

[[üïØÔ∏è]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="üíø" tags="" position="437,424" size="100,100">Perhaps there was not a distinct, singular moment in history when cowboys were appropriated by the queer community; however, if I were to choose one for the sake of being chaotic and incorrigible, it would be when Kylie Minogue released her not-quite-so-hit song [[‚ÄòCowboy Style‚Äô]] in 1997.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="üé¨" tags="" position="581,467" size="100,100">There may be too many answers for this question that make it seem like cowboys were destined to be a trope of queer desire; but the homosexual cowboy was not always a comfortable character.

In the 1969 film //Midnight Cowboy//, protagonist Joe Buck flees his hometown in Texas and a series of accompanying traumatic events to set himself up in NYC. He does so with the intention of pursuing his charms and good manners as a cowboy-clad sex worker.

It‚Äôs his good manners and positive attitude which, in the end, gets him rejected by the Upper East Side lonely ladies. After coming to terms with his lack of‚Äîand evidently preferred‚Äîheterosexual customers, he turns to homosexual men who already know the deal when it comes to shifty eyes [[on the street]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="üïØÔ∏è" tags="" position="719,467" size="100,100">To check the evidence, receipts, and archives hosted on niche historical and queer dating app websites, is to discover that cowboys, in fact, were a little bit gay all along.

These men, who worked on ranches far away from the company of women, created terminologies and vague conventions to normalise their testosteronal worlds.

In an article titled //Paradise of Bachelors: The Social World of Men in Nineteenth-Century America//, the line between the homosocial and the homosexual is said to have often been ‚Äúblurred‚Äù as gender roles were shifted, changed, and seemingly given far less importance than exterior [[societies.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="lyrics:" tags="" position="431,594" size="100,100">(enchant: ?passage&#39;s chars, via (t8n-delay:pos * 75) + (t8n:&#39;instant&#39;))

//Found my voice to have my say
You take me close to far away
And now I find and now I feel
The ordinary is surreal
Peace and terror all in one
My future life has just [[begun]]//</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="begun" tags="" position="447,724" size="100,100">The lyrics steer away from any typical cowboy tropes; but nonetheless, Kylie expresses a kind of philosophical cowboy narrative here: a rumination on individual journey,(click-replace: &quot;a rumination on individual journey,&quot;) [//Click clacking on a horse through the desert//;] disorientation,(click-replace: &quot;disorientation,&quot;) [//Where do I belong in this wild wild west?//;] and a conclusive sense of growth and triumph(click-replace: &quot;and a conclusive sense of growth and triumph&quot;) [//Never mind‚Äîall I need is me, my horse, and my harmonica//]. I‚Äôve often thought about this narrative‚Äîincorrigible again!‚Äîand have come to consider it a similitude of queer empowerment.

Where she sings of ‚Äòfinding her voice‚Äô and encountering the ‚Äòsurreal‚Äô, I imagine queer people in the heat of self-discovery. I imagine shaky knees  approaching a dancefloor because actualising a queer sexuality‚Äîa limb of one‚Äôs identity‚Äîis a process which demands a submission to the non-normative and this, in fact, is a ‚Äúpeace and terror all in one‚Äù.

[[If this is not a convincing argument...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="If this is not a convincing argument..." tags="" position="459,848" size="100,100">I will let this live performance of the song‚Äîparticularly at the 3:00 mark‚Äîsay it all.

These men in chaps are a such an extreme adaptation of OG cowboys that I wonder if it&#39;s hyper-masculine or something femme enough to make discriminatory MPs draw up further steps away from democracy. [[Which raises the question:-&gt;Which makes me think:]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="on the street" tags="" position="581,617" size="100,100">I cross my legs and straighten my back when I think back to one scene in particular.

Joe, desperate for cash to resist the winds of a city which is intent on sweeping him out, takes on a male client. When the gentleman client changes his mind about the transaction, Joe is enraged‚Äîpossessed, even.

Dollar signs in his eyes, he robs, beats, and plausibly kills the gentleman client by ramming the head of a rotary telephone through his [[through his mouth]].

As if there could be worse murder victims; worse responses to initiating homosexual affairs. This, of course, says more about the time this film was made, but the real kicker arrives when it becomes clear that Joe uses his cowboy outfit as a kind of armour‚Äîone that allows him to perform the worst kind of sharp-spurred masculinity. It‚Äôs used to stomp out any ember of acquitted queerness.

This masculine armour has been stretched and pulled and appropriated so many times it communicates something else entirely. [[Which makes me think:]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Which makes me think:" tags="masculinity" position="613,901" size="100,100">

WHAT KIND OF MACULINITY DOES THE COWBOY REPRESENT TODAY?

Perhaps using this word for spaghetti westerns as opposed to the operas she so favours in //Notes on Camp// will enrage Susan Sontag enough to claw through her coffin; however, there is something undeniably over-the-top about men in chaps spitting phlegm and philosophical asides. Which‚Äîin a somewhat roundabout way‚Äî[[often leads me to wonder:-&gt;a lot]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="‚ÄòCowboy Style‚Äô" tags="" position="306,517" size="100,100">The song itself is a sexualised ballad infused with conventional folk sounds. She sings of love, lust and empowerment, all in a soundscape that sounds as though it was birthed in a ranch and shipped off in a tractor to be done up in the city.

How this could be considered a song of queer admiration is largely implicit. Of course, I could rely on the self-explanatory answer of ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Kylie!‚Äô, but truly I think the explanation can be found in the song‚Äôs [[lyrics:]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="üö¨" tags="" position="557,1038" size="100,100">Is it America‚Äôs tobacco mascot, the Marlboro Man?
A classic example of how almost all mainstream marketing seems to be problematically gendered.

If this is the case, I don‚Äôt think I can continue this essay. [[Instead I might ask:]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="‚úä" tags="" position="757,941" size="100,100">Is it, in fact, feminism?

Anna North‚Äôs feminist Western novel Outlawed seems to me a good example of this. It follows Ada, a 17 year-old who escapes the misogynistic perils of 1894 by joining a gang of outcast women. Together they concoct a high-stakes plan to reclaim their right to live [[free from patriarchal dictatorship.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="societies." tags="" position="840,557" size="100,100">When I first scrolled through these sources I was doubtful of their legitimacy, but several photographs such as this one

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="intimate connection." tags="" position="764,681" size="100,100">Dances, in particular, are an interesting practice to zoom in on. In Southern California, miners used to partner up and sway with each other during their post-laborious evenings. One would dance the lead, and the other would wear a patch over their crotch to signify the ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô role. 

This, I imagine, must have been an easy way to surrender to the initially uncomfortable yet ever-present longing to be touched‚Äîeven just for a song or two. Perhaps this was also the kind of homosocial behaviour which allowed for men to live and work and travel together for extensive periods of their lives in what was referred to as [[‚Äòbachelor marriages‚Äô.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Instead I might ask:" tags="cowboy-energy" position="629,1169" size="100,100">

WHAT IS ‚ÄòCOWBOY ENERGY‚Äô?

[[üî•]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="üåπ" tags="" position="486,1202" size="100,100">Recently a friend of mine, C, declared to me that she was writing a country song. This was not out of character for C, given that the poems, Jamesons, and slow dances she&#39;d shared with me in the past had always felt like they belonged in a song.

She is, for this reason and many more, the zesty source of [[memorable moments.]]

&lt;audio src=&quot;./cowboyz-audio/country-song.mp3&quot; autoplay /&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="üî•" tags="" position="704,1319" size="100,100">For Gen Zs and almost anyone who has an indulgent taste for pop culture, the title of music‚Äôs most popular cowboy does not belong to Orville Peck alone. In 2019, rap artist Lil Nas X entered the country canon with his globally successful song ‚ÄòOld Time Road‚Äô.

For the two years that followed, Lil Nas balanced the archaic aesthetic of a traditional cowboy with not only the modern sound of hip-hop but also with his identity. Rarely has the world seen a queer, black cowboy celebrated on screens and this, I believe, is a form of [[cowboy energy.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="memorable moments." tags="" position="338,1294" size="100,100">One such moment involved rotten wood and a vision of near death.

We were neighbours at the time and ended a small night out with a night cap. In her backyard, we commented on her basil and nodded at the size of the zucchinis. We drank cab-sav, talked pasta plans and likely drifted onto a dramatic subject of something like, oh, say, I don&#39;t know, Love? One last wine became three last wines and from there we started spinning around to folk rock and country ballads.

This detail seems important now because it‚Äôs Tim Buckley who always brings me back to the moment of when I span around the pole of C‚Äôs backyard terrace roofing and snapped it all down [[on top of us.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="on top of us." tags="" position="317,1421" size="100,100">When we crawled out of the carnage and pinched our skin back to the present, I said sorry sorry sorry and C said tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow.

In fact, around the time she‚Äôd written her country song, C introduced me to //the// queer cowboy of country, Orville Peck.

On a designated banh mi bench in Fitzroy, she lovingly talked to me about his all frills mask and all frills beauty. And then she said: [[‚ÄúCowboy energy!‚Äù]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="‚ÄúCowboy energy!‚Äù" tags="" position="534,1516" size="100,100">This term, both familiar and foreign, is brought up in an interview with Orville for NME. He uses it as a way of describing vivaciousness, rebellious flair, bad b***h attitude; which, he says, can be found in the music of contemporary artists such as Janelle Mon√°e, Doja Cat, Billie Eilish, Tierra Whack, Megan Thee Stallion, and Rico Nasty.

By this way of thinking, the cowboy is not just a symbol or an aesthetic‚Äîit‚Äôs an attitude. It‚Äôs a means of creating and expressing which is innovative and infectious and a delight to step into. This energy evidently presents itself well in music. Songs are a popular medium for artists to [[kick up a yee-haw.]]

This year his aesthetic has snaked away from that of a cowboy and become something closer to a sexually liberated hedonist who seeks warmth from the flaming pits of Hell. Not far from being relatable, it‚Äôs political irony which speaks to his past as a renown Reddit troll. Though it‚Äôs earned him some media trouble, every person who has ever been made to feel guilty for wanting sex is living for it.

It‚Äôs the //nouveau vague// of cowboy energy‚Äîwhich is in fact nothing like a character from a Western film at all. Bearing this in mind, [[I wonder:]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="I wonder:" tags="something-else" position="690,1645" size="100,100">

Kind of like a finger gun in the air to prompt excitement for what will ultimately be a debaucherous and hedonistic event.

Gilford, being a rodeo regular himself, spent four years with the IGRA and documented scenes I can only call soft edged and warm. A bit like a hug.

The photographs portray an astonishing evolution of a traditionally conservative and very exclusive sport. What solitude may have persisted in its heteronormative past is clearly being challenged one firm ass and tiara at a time.

I would try to put this into words, but perhaps the photos will speak better for [[themselves:]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="themselves:" tags="" position="692,2010" size="100,100">[[&lt;img src=&quot;cowboyz-images/lg-1.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;756&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; alt &quot;a picture of two naked cowboys on a horse&quot;&gt;-&gt;LG2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="LG2" tags="" position="695,2128" size="100,100">[[&lt;img src=&quot;cowboyz-images/lg-2.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;740&quot; alt &quot;a picture of someone in drag&quot;&gt;-&gt;LG3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="LG3" tags="" position="697,2248" size="100,100">[[&lt;img src=&quot;cowboyz-images/lg-3.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;740&quot; alt &quot;a  picture of a drag queen pagaent winner&quot;&gt;-&gt;LG4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="LG4" tags="" position="696,2371" size="100,100">[[&lt;img src=&quot;cowboyz-images/lg-4.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;740&quot; alt &quot;a  picture of a cowboy wearing big earrings&quot;&gt;-&gt;LG5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="LG5" tags="" position="696,2491" size="100,100">[[&lt;img src=&quot;cowboyz-images/lg-5.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;740&quot; alt &quot;a  picture of a drag queen cowboy riding a horse&quot;&gt;-&gt;LG6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="LG6" tags="" position="699,2614" size="100,100">[[&lt;img src=&quot;cowboyz-images/lg-6.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;740&quot; alt &quot;a  picture of a cowboy rubbing his hand up another cowboys shirt&quot;&gt;-&gt;LG7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="LG7" tags="" position="699,2732" size="100,100">[[&lt;img src=&quot;cowboyz-images/lg-7.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;740&quot; alt &quot;a  picture of a black cowgirl&quot;&gt;-&gt;LG8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="LG8" tags="" position="699,2854" size="100,100">[[&lt;img src=&quot;cowboyz-images/lg-8.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;740&quot; alt &quot;a  picture of an interracial lesbian cowgirl couple who are hugging each other topless&quot;&gt;-&gt;LG9]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="47" name="LG9" tags="" position="700,2970" size="100,100">[[&lt;img src=&quot;cowboyz-images/lg-9.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;740&quot; alt &quot;a  picture of a horse&#39;s mane dyed pink and braided&quot;&gt;-&gt;LG10]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="48" name="LG10" tags="" position="700,3088" size="100,100">[[&lt;img src=&quot;cowboyz-images/lg-10.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;740&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; alt &quot;a  picture of three cowboys embracing each other&quot;&gt;-&gt;the cowboy.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="49" name="free from patriarchal dictatorship." tags="" position="766,1079" size="100,100">The idea of a gang of rebels seems to be the point of difference between what a traditional western and a feminist western might pursue. Female solidarity being a culture of rebellion, but also of community.

I struggle to summon to mind a classic western storyline in which the gang of men pillaged a town for the sake of countering oppression and building a network of support. But this may just be my lack of knowledge when it comes to Western novels. I‚Äôll let Anna North decide.

Rebellion is a word that is inextricable from cowboy narratives. It‚Äôs an ethos; or maybe more so, an //energy//, and hell [[this makes me think:-&gt;Instead I might ask:]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="50" name="kick up a yee-haw." tags="" position="547,1647" size="100,100">But when I think of C and the egg on her head as she looked at her broken terrace, the lyrics of her country song which make mention of flirting with a bartender, and the chuckling we cover with our hands when we remember other stories, I think that cowboy energy may be found elsewhere too.

With the spirit of cowboys found in places outside of saloons and gun holsters, [[I have to ask:-&gt;I wonder:]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="51" name="glamour had very little to do with it." tags="" position="953,1925" size="100,100">In the Western suburbs of Philadelphia where crime rates are high, stable owner Mike Divers encourages youths to ride horses as a means of distracting them from ‚Äúsenseless killing‚Äù.

It‚Äôs a ‚Äòbusy hands‚Äô approach to traumatic upbringings and the stresses of [[unjust social problems.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="52" name="unjust social problems." tags="" position="987,2109" size="100,100">When I think of the cowboy‚Äîin his clich√© character form at least‚ÄîI think of a man who is enchanted by danger; seeks it, even.

But young men like Shahir are not tempted. He talks about losing family and friends and the very real consequences of violence. This is what is always kept off the silver screen when cowboys lose sight of their shoot-ups: the grief.

This may be one of the undisclosed but more positive developments in the modernisation of [[the cowboy.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="53" name="‚Äòbachelor marriages‚Äô." tags="" position="743,807" size="100,100">To call this homosexual at the time would have been impossible, given that the word itself only came about in 1868 (and the word ‚Äòheterosexual‚Äô even later in 1928). Even after this linguistic division, it‚Äôs evident that gender roles were still present in these men‚Äôs practices.

Native Americans, however, were far more advanced in this way of thinking. For example, non-binary individuals were commonplace yet integral members of society and given the name of berdaches. This was true for over 130 indigenous tribes.

Today the West is only just starting to develop this kind of vocaublary and a lot of this has to do with the presence of gender stereotypes. And so [[I have to ask:-&gt;Which makes me think:]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="54" name="the cowboy." tags="" position="1003,3276" size="100,100">The aesthetic of the cowboy has made longer journeys than I suspect most ranch workers and  spaghetti Western actors would have assumed.

This journey has not been linear, and by no means does it look it ever will be. I might choose to use the word ‚Äòtimeless‚Äô, but perhaps the more appropriate word is ‚Äòadaptable‚Äô. This, I think is a trait that deserves [[some admiration.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="55" name="some admiration." tags="" position="1003,3418" size="100,100">Before this essay I‚Äôd never really given cowboys more thought than their convenience as a good last minute shake-and-go costume. But now I sit here at my desk, sporting a brimmed-hat and planning a cowboy tattoo for the sake and love of Pure! Camp! (Thank you again Susan. You may RIP now).

Cowboys are now about to be etched onto me‚Äîand not just because they are funnysillysexy, but because they are a means of opening conversations and drawing connections in the world. These two traits are today and tomorrow, more valuable than ever.

So //Yee-haw// and ü§† to you, dear reader.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
